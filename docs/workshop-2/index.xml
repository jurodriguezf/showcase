The ability to represent three-dimensional (3D) objects and environments opens up a new dimension of possibilities for learning. In this article, the topic of dynamic environments will be explored by implementing a three-dimensional interactive game using the p5.js library. The focus of this study is to develop a game environment in which a player-controlled cube moves within a cubic arena, collecting randomly generated food items while avoiding obstacles and trying to score as many points as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
