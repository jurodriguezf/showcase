To achieve this effect, there are three essential components needed in creating a painting or drawing using linear perspective:
Orthogonals (also known as parallel lines) Vanishing point Horizon line Using these components, it is possible to arrange the composition of a work of art in a way similar to how the human eye sees the world.</description></item><item><title>Visual Illusions</title><link>https://jurodriguezf.github.io/showcase/docs/workshop-1/illusions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jurodriguezf.github.io/showcase/docs/workshop-1/illusions/</guid><description>Visual Illusions # Introduction # Visual illusions, also known as optical illusions, are perceptual phenomena that deceive or mislead our visual system, causing us to perceive things differently from how they actually are. These illusions occur due to the way our eyes, brain, and visual processing system interpret and process visual information.
Visual illusions can take various forms and exploit different aspects of our perception, including depth, motion, size, color, and shape.</description></item></channel></rss>
