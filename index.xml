The ability to represent three-dimensional (3D) objects and environments opens up a new dimension of possibilities for learning. In this article, the topic of dynamic environments will be explored by implementing a three-dimensional interactive game using the p5.js library. The focus of this study is to develop a game environment in which a player-controlled cube moves within a cubic arena, collecting randomly generated food items while avoiding obstacles and trying to score as many points as possible.</description></item><item><title>Linear Perspective, DOF, Parallax</title><link>https://jurodriguezf.github.io/showcase/docs/workshop-1/joint-example/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jurodriguezf.github.io/showcase/docs/workshop-1/joint-example/</guid><description>Joint workshop: Linear Perspective, DOF and Parallax # Introduction # Linear perspective is a technique used by artists to create the illusion of depth and space using relative size and position of a group of objects. To achieve this effect, there are three essential components needed in creating a painting or drawing using linear perspective:
Orthogonals (also known as parallel lines) Vanishing point Horizon line Using these components, it is possible to arrange the composition of a work of art in a way similar to how the human eye sees the world.</description></item><item><title>Photomosaic Simple Implementation</title><link>https://jurodriguezf.github.io/showcase/docs/workshop-1/photomosaic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jurodriguezf.github.io/showcase/docs/workshop-1/photomosaic/</guid><description> Photomosaic # Introduction # Image DB taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset

These illusions occur due to the way our eyes, brain, and visual processing system interpret and process visual information.
Visual illusions can take various forms and exploit different aspects of our perception, including depth, motion, size, color, and shape.</description></item></channel></rss>
