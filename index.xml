To achieve this effect, there are three essential components needed in creating a painting or drawing using linear perspective:
Orthogonals (also known as parallel lines) Vanishing point Horizon line Using these components, it is possible to arrange the composition of a work of art in a way similar to how the human eye sees the world.</description></item><item><title>Game Development</title><link>https://jurodriguezf.github.io/showcase/docs/space-transformations/game-development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jurodriguezf.github.io/showcase/docs/space-transformations/game-development/</guid><description>3D Snake Game # Introduction # In the realm of web development, p5.js has gained significant popularity for its simplicity and versatility in creating interactive graphics and animations. The ability to represent three-dimensional (3D) objects and environments opens up a new dimension of possibilities for learning. In this article, the topic of dynamic environments will be explored by implementing a three-dimensional interactive game using the p5.js library. The focus of this study is to develop a game environment in which a player-controlled cube moves within a cubic arena, collecting randomly generated food items while avoiding obstacles and trying to score as many points as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
